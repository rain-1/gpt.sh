tmux split-window -h 'btop; nvtop'
error connecting to /tmp/tmux-1000/default (No such file or directory)

Had to ask ChatGPT:

tmux new-session -d 'btop'; tmux split-window -h 'nvtop'; tmux attach

This command creates a new detached tmux session, launches btop in the first pane, splits the window horizontally, and runs nvtop in the second pane. Finally, it attaches to the newly created session, allowing you to view both programs side by side.

If you encounter any further issues, please let me know.
